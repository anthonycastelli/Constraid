# Constraid

Constraid is your personal `NSLayoutConsraint` Aid. It's job is to make it as simple as
possible for you to programmatically use AutoLayout in your iOS projects.

For example if you have a child view (`childView`) added as a subview of a parent
view (`parentView`) and you want that child view to match the width of the parent view you would
normally do the following with AutoLayout:

```swift
childView.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false

NSLayoutConstraint.activate([
    NSLayoutConstraint(
        item: childView,
        attribute: .leadingEdge,
        relatedBy: .equal,
        toItem: parentView,
        attribute: .leadingEdge,
        multiplier: 1.0,
        constant: 0.0
    ),
    NSLayoutConstraint(
        item: childView,
        attribute: .trailingEdge,
        relatedBy: .equal,
        toItem: parentView,
        attribute: .trailingEdge,
        multiplier: 1.0,
        constant: 0.0
    )
])
```

However, with the aid of [Constraid][constraid] it is as simple as

```swift
childView.flush(withVerticalEdgesOf: parentView)
```

## Build

We supports [Carthage][carthage] and therefore this project can be built using the folowing.

```
carthage build --no-skip-current
```

However, if you don't want to use [Carthage][carthage] or you are having difficulties with
build failures you can try the following which should provide some more details.

```
xcodebuild -scheme Constraid -project Constraid.xcodeproj build
```
